Remake of https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=1260021
with new features

Commands:
"sm_future" "Allow you to do a cmd in the future"

"sm_futurelist" "See all the running futures"

"sm_futurekill" "Kill a running future"


This plugin doesnt use server command (Like the original) so if an admin doesnt have the access of the command he's trying to do It wont be executed.
